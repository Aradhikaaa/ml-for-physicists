## Tutorial Description

This code demonstrates how to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to predict the coordinate of a particle based on previous observations. The physical example used involves a 'heavy' particle immersed in a bath of 'light' particles. The task is to predict the coordinate of one of the light particles using only the motion data of the heavy particle.

Key Points:
- Train an LSTM network to predict coordinates.
- Utilize memory from past observations to make predictions about other particles.
